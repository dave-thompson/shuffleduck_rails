#ShuffleDuck

SHUFFLEDUCK was a flashcard-based education platform.  It comprised:

- a Flash / ActionScript WYSIWIG flashcard editor
- an iOS app for studying hi-fidelity flashcards
- a Ruby on Rails backend for managing access to the global card library and synchronising cardsets between the Flash and iOS apps

##This Repository

This repository contains the Flash / Actionscript component.

##Licensing

The ShuffleDuck project is not specifically licenced for open source use - you're unlikely to find anything interesting within it and the technologies used are very out of date.  Feel free to look around though and in the unlikely event that you do find something you'd like to use, just let me know and I'll provide a licence allowing you to do so.
